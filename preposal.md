# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Some ideas I have for my final project are an app that gives the user a kind act to do each day 
like complimenting someones shoes that will spread kindness into the world or a trivia game that 
asks questions that will help you learn about different cultures and traditions. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working with just myself for this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No, Not as of right now.
