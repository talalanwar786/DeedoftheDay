# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Kind Spark

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows you to click a button which then displays something nice for you to do. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will have a coded button. It will have many possibilities of kind things you can do for the day. For example, "compliment someones outfit".
I also want it to have a chat but I am not sure if it will be possible to do. Lastly, I'll try to make it possible to customize the background of the website
to the users liking. It will be executed by simply left clicking the button on the screen. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Button that displays nice thing to do

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Chat that allows you to talk to other people on the website

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to even make a functional button. I have never actually worked on a project myself using code so 
I am excited to see what I can get done. I think I will have to research how other games add a chat that you can talk to 
other people in. I feel like that will be the hardest part of the project to do for me, but I really want to be able to
do that. I am not working with anybody else, so it will be more difficult for me to create an actual impressive app in the time given. Please be easy on me :D
